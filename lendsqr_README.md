## **IMPLEMENTATION**

 ### **what's in here?**
The idea behind this project is to create a system where:
* a user can create an account.
* a user can make deposits into their account.
* a user can transfer funds to another user's account.
* a user can make withdrawals from their account.

### **How it was implemented?**

### **GULP**
Gulp is a toolkit to automate repetitive tasks. Here, I used it to compile JavaScript ES6. Running the **GULP**  command first converts TypeScript to JavaScript.


```
npm i gulp-install
```
